# Simple Schedule Tool Project

## Description

This website serves as practice for using jQuery and third party APIs. In this project I use luxon, a third party API for getting the current time and date. This is a simple scheduler for a single day. It is updated based on what hour of the day it is currently, showing description boxes in different colors depending whether it is in the past, present, or future. You can refresh the page after saving events and they will still be there, as they are saved in the localStorage.

## Installation

You can download the files from GitHub, open them in VS Code, and use "run from browser" to run the page from your own computer.

Alternatively, you can visit the github links I created: 
URL of deployed webpage: https://cjrhansen2.github.io/SimpleSchedule/
URL of GitHub repository: https://github.com/cjrhansen2/SimpleSchedule

## Usage

Click in the text area to write a new event. Once you have written the event, save it by clicking the blue button on the right associated with the event. This will save it to the localStorage, try refreshing the page to see this feature.
